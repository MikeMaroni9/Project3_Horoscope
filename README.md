<h1> Horoscope Checker - Zodiac </h1>
<p> This is a relatively simple horoscope application that uses user input data to generate user details, horoscope sign, description and Chinese horoscope about the user. </p>
<p> As I was mourning loss in the family I was hoping for an extension but haven't heard nothing back I decided to give my best and at least make something that I can hand in.</p>
<p> Have been working on this project for past two days now and I hope that it is enough to pass the python course. I could have included more of my knowledge, make classes and include error checking, and all other good things, but frankly I am running out of time.</p>
<h2>Deployment<h2>
    <ul>I have commited all the files and pushed them on to the repository. </ul>
    <ul>Connected the project with the Heroku and you can view the finished project here:</ul>
    <ul>https://zodiac-horoscope.herokuapp.com/ </ul>

 <h2> The Persistant Problems </h2>
 <p> As the dictionary entries take up much space it's physically impossible to adjust them to the small Heroku window for output. I am lacking "knowhow" to figure this out frankly time is of the essence. My thought is that probably I could split each long entry into multiple smaller entries and then print the all out together one by one. But frankly I don't mind that they are being split automatically to the next line. </p>
 <p> The python code checker doesn't like the ASCII art and throw errors, but I don't think there's anything I can do about that.</p>
 <p> Those are only errors that the checker doesn't like, line lenght and ascii art</p>
